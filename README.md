## Description

<p>The <b>QR Code Generator API Challenge</b> project is the best beginner level api project in the series, here we will build a user interface with some settings in HTML and CSS, we then will add some functionality to it with JavaScript and give the user a result they can use!</p>

<p>Many have requested to have a code along that starts from scratch and that’s what we’re going to do in this one, step by step, build every line together and bring it to the end result so if you're into that - be sure to check the YouTube link above. But of course you're always welcome to try it out yourself!</p>

<p>In this project we will work with input fields, fieldset, buttons, with attributes - adding/removing/changing them depending on user’s input. You will get to create a user interface based on the options the API gives us, ensure the user provides us with the requires information and give the user feedback if not, etc. Bottom line - it’s going to be a lot of fun ✨</p>
